Markov Chains in the Game of Baseball:

The goal of this project is to understand the usage of Markov Chains in baseball and how they can give a
team competitive advantages.

The average revenue for a baseball team associated the Major League Baseball is $122.1 million. However,
one can expect better performing teams bring in more money. Thus, teams have begun looking at all ways
possible to get the most amount of wins during their season. One way to gain a competitive edge is to view
the game from a statistical standpoint. Markov Chains have been brought into the game of baseball as a
way to predict outcomes in order to make better strategic choices during play.

While much more can be done with Markov Chains to compute event probabilities for a baseball game than
what is discussed in my paper, it is important to see the foundation for such calculations.
